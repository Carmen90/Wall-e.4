/**
 * @author Carmen Acosta Morales y Nerea Ramirez Lamela 
 * his interface represents an instruction supported by the application.
 *  Every instruction that the robot may perform implements this interface.
 *  It forces instructions to provide with the implementation of four different methods:
   Parse method tries to parse a string with the information of the instruction the class represents
   Help method returns a string with an explanation of the kind of expression that the parse method supports
   ConfigureContext method establishes the context needed to execute the instruction
   Execute method performs the actual work of the instruction, executing it.
   The execute method does not have any parameter. 
   Therefore the context of execution must be given to the instruction object prior to its invocation using the configureContext method.
   Note that the actual context depends on the subclass because the information needed varies between instructions.
